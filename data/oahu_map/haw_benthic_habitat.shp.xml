  Description:
    Abstract:
      This project is a cooperative effort between the National
      Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Science Center
      for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment with the University
      of Hawaii and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The
      goal of the work was to develop coral reef mapping methods
      and compare benthic habitat maps generated by
      photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, 
      hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery. The line work 
      in this shape file was generated from all remotely sensed 
      data for the Island of Hawaii collected by NOAA during the 
      year 2000 acquision mission in Hawaii.  This project was 
      supported by NOAA.
    Purpose:
      This project was conducted in support of the Coral Reef
      Task Force.

DATA_QUALITY_INFORMATION

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Vector boundaries of habitat areas were delineated by 
      photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, 
      AURORA hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery.  The 
      polygons were attributed using the the NOAA coral reef habitat 
      digitizing extension in ArcView GIS format.  Thus attributes are 
      generated directly in the shape file and errors are not expected.
      The shape files are free of multipart polygons, overlapping polygons, 
      sliver polygons, void polygons and are free of adjacency error.
      Overall accuracy of the major habitat classifications in these data
      is greater than 90%.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    All digitizing was conducted using the "heads up" on screen
    method deliniating habitat boundaries by photointerpretation of the 
    imagery. All imagery data were set to 1:6,000 scale during 
    photointerpretation and map preparation.  The digital imagery these 
    maps are based on are believed to be logically consistent, although 
    not tested. 
  Completeness_Report:
    Data are complete. Habitat boundaries are based on
    photointerpretaion of imagery of ground condition at the
    time the imagery was collected. Shore lines are subject to
    change over time due to natural erosion and vegetaion
    growth processes. Habitat boundaries are subject to change
    over time due to population dynamics of the dominant
    bioligical communities. The habitat boundaries in this GIS theme
    are intended to be used by living marine resource
    managers. They do not represent boundaries intended to be
    used for legal purposes.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        RMS from digitized output was determined using the ESRI RMEer2
        extension and shown to be <1m when conducted at 1:6000 scale.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Orthorectified mosaiced color aerial photogrphs, AURORA 
        hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery were provided 
        to the contractor in geotif format.  These were loaded into
        ArcView 3.2 GIS software with the Image Analysis and NOAA
        Coral Reef Habitat Digitizing extensions both activated. A
        photointerpreter delineated habitat boundaries directly
        into the digitally referenced GIS at 1:6000 scale. Polygon
        data were saved as ArcView Shapefiles.
