# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing machine learning models to predict coral recovery using environmental and biological data. The system will implement two different modeling approaches (XGBoost and Neural Network) to analyze coral health data and identify the most important features contributing to coral recovery. The models will be trained on coral bleaching data, environmental conditions, sedimentation, wave data, and coral sample metadata to provide insights into coral resilience and recovery patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a marine biologist, I want to train machine learning models on coral data, so that I can predict coral recovery outcomes based on environmental conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads coral data THEN it SHALL successfully read and parse all CSV files (bleaching.csv, depth_data.csv, environmental_summary.csv, metadata_coral_samples.csv, metadata_site_locations.csv, sedimentation_data.csv, wave_data.csv)
2. WHEN data preprocessing is performed THEN the system SHALL handle missing values, normalize features, and create appropriate target variables for coral recovery prediction
3. WHEN model training is initiated THEN the system SHALL train both XGBoost and Neural Network models using the processed data
4. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to identify the most important features for coral recovery, so that I can understand which environmental factors most influence coral resilience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature importance analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate and rank feature importance scores for both models
2. WHEN feature importance is calculated THEN the system SHALL generate visualizations showing the top contributing features
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide interpretable results showing which environmental variables (DHW, depth, sedimentation, wave action, etc.) are most predictive of recovery
4. IF feature importance differs between models THEN the system SHALL highlight and explain the differences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want a configurable pipeline, so that I can easily adjust model parameters and experiment with different configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL read configuration parameters from a config.yaml file
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL support parameters for model hyperparameters, data preprocessing options, and analysis settings
3. WHEN different configurations are used THEN the system SHALL maintain reproducible results through proper random seed management
4. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL log configuration details and model parameters used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a complete automated pipeline, so that I can run the entire analysis workflow with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN main.py is executed THEN the system SHALL run the complete pipeline including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis
2. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive results including model performance metrics, feature importance rankings, and visualizations
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful failure handling
4. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL save model artifacts, results, and analysis outputs to appropriate directories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to compare model performance, so that I can select the best approach for coral recovery prediction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both models are trained THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance comparisons
2. WHEN model evaluation is performed THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation or train/test splits to ensure robust performance estimates
3. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL include confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other relevant evaluation visualizations
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL recommend which model performs better for the specific coral recovery prediction task
