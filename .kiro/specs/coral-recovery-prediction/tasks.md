# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create config.yaml configuration file





  - Define data paths, model hyperparameters, and analysis settings
  - Include XGBoost and Neural Network configuration sections
  - Set up cross-validation, output directories, and random seeds
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Create src/analysis.py for data processing and analysis





  - Implement CoralDataProcessor class for loading all CSV datasets
  - Add data integration, preprocessing, and feature engineering functions
  - Create target variable generation from coral health status
  - Include feature importance analysis and visualization functions
  - Add comprehensive error handling for data operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Create src/models.py with both model implementations








  - Implement BaseCoralModel abstract class with common interface
  - Create CoralXGBoostModel class with XGBoost implementation
  - Create CoralNeuralNetwork class with TensorFlow/Keras implementation
  - Add model evaluation, feature importance, and prediction methods
  - Include cross-validation and performance metrics for both models
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Create main.py pipeline orchestration





  - Implement complete workflow from data loading to results generation
  - Add configuration loading and command-line argument parsing
  - Include model training, evaluation, and comparison functionality
  - Add comprehensive logging and progress tracking
  - Implement results saving and visualization generation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Run and test the complete pipeline





  - Execute main.py with the coral datasets
  - Verify data loading and preprocessing works correctly
  - Confirm both models train successfully and produce predictions
  - Validate feature importance analysis and visualizations are generated
  - Check that results are saved properly and performance metrics are calculated
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 4.2, 5.1_

- [ ] 6. Debug and optimize the implementation




  - Fix any data loading or preprocessing issues
  - Resolve model training errors or convergence problems
  - Optimize performance and memory usage for large datasets
  - Improve error handling and add missing edge case handling
  - Refine visualizations and output formatting
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 1.2, 1.4_
